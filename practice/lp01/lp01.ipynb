The idea is that if people know that educated women can get good jobs, they might take more care of the health and education of girls in their families, as an investment in the girls’ future potential as earners. Without the knowledge of job opportunities, the author hypothesizes that families invest less in their women, and instead, invest in their men. \n\nThe study focused on 160 villages outside the capital of India, all with little access to information about call centers and similar organizations that offer job opportunities to women. In 80 of the villages chosen at random, recruiters visited the village, described the opportunities, recruited women who had some English language proficiency and experience with computers, and provided ongoing support free of charge for three years. In the other 80 villages, no recruiters visited and no other intervention was made.\n\nAt the end of the study period, the researchers recorded data about the school attendance and health of the children in the villages."

After the Broad Street cholera epidemic ended, Whitehead set about trying to prove Snow wrong.  (The history of the event is detailed [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1034367/pdf/medhist00183-0026.pdf).)\n\nHe realized that Snow had focused his analysis almost entirely on those who had died. Whitehead, therefore, investigated the drinking habits of people in the Broad Street area who had not died in the outbreak.\n\nWhat is the main reason it was important to study this group?\n\n1) If Whitehead had found that many people had drunk water from the Broad Street pump and not caught cholera, that would have been evidence against Snow's hypothesis.\n\n2) Survivors could provide additional information about what else could have caused the cholera, potentially unearthing another cause.\n\n3) Through considering the survivors, Whitehead could have identified a cure for cholera."
