The data is in the file `causes_of_death.csv.zip`. Each row records the number of deaths by a specific cause in one year in one ZIP code.\n\nTo make the file smaller, we've compressed it; run the next cell to unzip and load it."

It looks like those causes of death are relatively rare, so for some purposes it makes sense to drop them from consideration.  Of course, we'll have to keep in mind that we're no longer looking at a comprehensive report on all deaths in California.\n\n**Question 1.** Let's clean up our data. First, filter out the HOM, HYP, and NEP rows from the table for the reasons described above. Next, join together the abbreviations table and our causes of death table so that we have a more detailed discription of each disease in each row. Lastly, drop the column which contains the acronym of the disease, and rename the column with the full description 'Cause of Death'. Assign the variable `cleaned_causes` to the resulting table. \n\n*Hint:* You should expect this to take more than one line. Use many lines and many intermediate tables to complete this question. "
