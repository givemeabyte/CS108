But we need to discuss data types to deepen our understanding of how to work with data in Python.\n\nIn this lab, you'll first see how to represent and manipulate another fundamental type of data: text.  A piece of text is called a *string* in Python. You'll also see how to work with *arrays* of data, such as all the numbers between 0 and 100 or all the words in the chapter of a book. Lastly, you'll create tables and practice analyzing them with your knowledge of table operations."

The word \"string\" is a programming term for a sequence of characters. A string might contain a single character, a word, a sentence, or a whole book.\n\nTo distinguish text data from actual code, we demarcate strings by putting quotation marks around them. Single quotes (`'`) and double quotes (`\"`) are both valid, but the types of opening and closing quotation marks must match. The contents can be any sequence of characters, including numbers and symbols. \n\nWe've seen strings before in `print` statements.

One way to do this is by using the logarithm function. The logarithm (base 10) of a number increases by 1 every time we multiply the number by 10. It's like a measure of how many decimal digits the number has, or how big it is in orders of magnitude.\n\nWe could try to answer our question like this, using the `log10` function from the `math` module and the `item` method you just saw:"

Then an array could describe the land area of each state. \n\nTables extend this idea by containing multiple arrays, each one describing a different attribute for every element of a collection. In this way, tables allow us to not only store data about many entities but to also contain several kinds of data about each entity.\n\nFor example, in the cell below we have two arrays. The first one, `population_amounts`, was defined above in section 2.2 and contains the world population in each year (estimated by the US Census Bureau). The second array, `years`, contains the years themselves. These elements are in order, so the year and the world population for that year have the same index in their corresponding arrays."

In cases like these, it might be easier to put the data into a *`Table`*, a 2-dimensional type of dataset. \n\nThe expression below:\n\n- creates an empty table using the expression `Table()`,\n- adds two columns by calling `with_columns` with four arguments,\n- assigns the result to the name `population`, and finally\n- evaluates `population` so that we can see the table.\n\nThe strings `\"Year\"` and `\"Population\"` are column labels that we have chosen.

So `5 % 2` is 1 and `6 % 2` is 0.  A number is even if the remainder is 0 when you divide by 2.\n\n*Hint 2:* `%` can be used on arrays, operating elementwise like `+` or `*`.  So `make_array(5, 6, 7) % 2` is `array([1, 0, 1])`.\n\n*Hint 3:* Create a column called \"Year Remainder\" that's the remainder when each movie's release year is divided by 2.  Make a copy of `imdb` that includes that column (`imdb.with_column(...)` returns a new table).  Then use `where` to find rows where that new column is equal to 0.  Then use `num_rows` to count the number of such rows."
