      "source": "# 1. Review: The building blocks of Python code\n\nThe two building blocks of Python code are *expressions* and *statements*.  An **expression** is a piece of code that\n\n* is self-contained, meaning it would make sense to write it on a line by itself, and\n* usually evaluates to a value.\n\n\nHere are two expressions that both evaluate to 3:\n\n    3\n    5 - 2\n    \nOne important type of expression is the **call expression**. A call expression begins with the name of a function and is followed by the argument(s) of that function in parentheses. The function returns some value, based on its arguments. Some important mathematical functions are listed below.\n\n| Function | Description                                                   |\n|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `abs`      | Returns the absolute value of its argument                    |\n| `max`      | Returns the maximum of all its arguments                      |\n| `min`      | Returns the minimum of all its arguments                      |\n| `pow`      | Raises its first argument to the power of its second argument |\n| `round`    | Rounds its argument to the nearest integer                     |\n\nHere are two call expressions that both evaluate to 3:\n\n    abs(2 - 5)\n    max(round(2.8), min(pow(2, 10), -1 * pow(2, 10)))\n\nThe expression `5 - 2` and the two call expressions given above are examples of **compound expressions**, meaning that they are actually combinations of several smaller expressions.  `5 - 2` combines the expressions `5` and `2` by subtraction.  In this case, `5` and `2` are called **subexpressions** because they're expressions that are part of a larger expression.\n\nA **statement** is a whole line of code.  Some statements are just expressions.  The expressions listed above are examples.\n\nOther statements *make something happen* rather than *having a value*. For example, an **assignment statement** assigns a value to a name. \n\nA good way to think about this is that we're **evaluating the right-hand side** of the equals sign and **assigning it to the left-hand side**. Here are some assignment statements:\n    \n    height = 1.3\n    the_number_five = abs(-5)\n    absolute_height_difference = abs(height - 1.688)\n\nAn important idea in programming is that large, interesting things can be built by combining many simple, uninteresting things.  The key to understanding a complicated piece of code is breaking it down into its simple components.\n\nFor example, a lot is going on in the last statement above, but it's really just a combination of a few things.  This picture describes what's going on.\n\n<img src=\"statement.png\">"

Importing code\n\n> What has been will be again,  \n> what has been done will be done again;  \n> there is nothing new under the sun.\n\nMost programming involves work that is very similar to work that has been done before.  Since writing code is time-consuming, it's good to rely on others' published code when you can.  Rather than copy-pasting, Python allows us to **import modules**. A module is a file with Python code that has defined variables and functions. By importing a module, we are able to use its code in our own notebook.\n\nPython includes many useful modules that are just an `import` away.  We'll look at the `math` module as a first example. The `math` module is extremely useful in computing mathematical expressions in Python. \n\nSuppose we want to very accurately compute the area of a circle with a radius of 5 meters.  For that, we need the constant $\\pi$, which is roughly 3.14.  Conveniently, the `math` module has `pi` defined for us:"

For example, `math` provides the name `sin` for the sine function.  Having imported `math` already, we can write `math.sin(3)` to compute the sine of 3.  (Note that this sine function considers its argument to be in [radians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian), not degrees.  180 degrees are equivalent to $\\pi$ radians.)\n\n**Question 2.1.1.** A $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$-radian (45-degree) angle forms a right triangle with equal base and height, pictured below.  If the hypotenuse (the radius of the circle in the picture) is 1, then the height is $\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{4})$.  Compute that value using `sin` and `pi` from the `math` module.

It has a default value of `False`, so when you explicitly tell the function `descending=True`, then the function will sort in descending order.)\n\n### `sort`\n\nSome details about sort:\n\n1. The first argument to `sort` is the name of a column to sort by.\n2. If the column has text in it, `sort` will sort alphabetically; if the column has numbers, it will sort numerically.\n3. The value of `farmers_markets_locations.sort(\"x\")` is a *copy* of `farmers_markets_locations`; the `farmers_markets_locations` table doesn't get modified. For example, if we called `farmers_markets_locations.sort(\"x\")`, then running `farmers_markets_locations` by itself would still return the unsorted table.\n4. Rows always stick together when a table is sorted.  It wouldn't make sense to sort just one column and leave the other columns alone.  For example, in this case, if we sorted just the `x` column, the farmers' markets would all end up with the wrong longitudes.\n\n**Question 3.5.** Create a version of `farmers_markets_locations` that's sorted by **latitude (`y`)**, with the largest latitudes first.  Call it `farmers_markets_locations_by_latitude`."
