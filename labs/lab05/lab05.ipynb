Otherwise, we return `'Negative'`.\n\nIf we want to test multiple conditions at once, we use the following general format.\n\n```\nif <if expression>:\n    <if body>\nelif <elif expression 0>:\n    <elif body 0>\nelif <elif expression 1>:\n    <elif body 1>\n...\nelse:\n    <else body>\n```\n\nOnly the body for the first conditional expression that is true will be evaluated. Each `if` and `elif` expression is evaluated and considered in order, starting at the top. As soon as a true value is found, the corresponding body is executed, and the rest of the conditional statement is skipped. If none of the `if` or `elif` expressions are true, then the `else body` is executed. \n\nFor more examples and explanation, refer to the section on conditional statements [here](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/09/1/conditional-statements.html)."

For 492 players, it's not so unreasonable to expect to see all the data, but usually we aren't so lucky.  Instead, we often make statistical inferences about a large underlying population using a smaller sample.\n\n### Statistical inference\n\nA *statistical inference* is a statement about some statistic of the underlying population, such as \"the average salary of NBA players in 2014 was $3\".  You may have heard the word \"inference\" used in other contexts.  It's important to keep in mind that statistical inferences, unlike, say, logical inferences, can be wrong.\n\nA general strategy for inference using samples is to estimate statistics of the population by computing the same statistics on a sample.  This strategy sometimes works well and sometimes doesn't.  The degree to which it gives us useful answers depends on several factors, and we'll touch lightly on a few of those today.\n\nOne very important factor in the utility of samples is how they were gathered.  We have prepared some example sample datasets to simulate inference from different kinds of samples for the NBA player dataset.

By default, it draws at random *with replacement* from the rows of a table. It takes in the sample size as its argument and returns a *table* with only the rows that were selected.
