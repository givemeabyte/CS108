Certain practictioners claim they have the ability to feel the HEF and can massage it in order to promote health and relaxation in individuals. Those who practice TT have described different people's HEFs as \"warm as Jell-O\" and \"tactile as taffy\". \n\nTT was a popular technique used throughout the 20th century that was toted to be a great way to bring balance to a person's health. \n\n### Emily Rosa\n\n[Emily Rosa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Rosa) was a 4th grade student who had wide exposure to the world of TT due to her parents. Her parents were both medical practitioners and skeptics of the idea of TT. \n\nFor her 4th grade science fair project, Emily decided to test whether or not TT practitioners could truly interact with a person's HEF.

Due to her parents' occupations in the medical field, she had wide access to people who claimed to be TT practitioners. \n\nEmily took 21 TT practitioners and used them for her science experiment. She would take a TT practitioner and ask them to extend their hands through a screen (which they can't see through). Emily would be on the other side and would flip a coin. Depending on how the coin landed, she would put out either her left hand or her right hand. The TT practitioner would then have to correctly answer which hand Emily put out. Overall, through 210 samples, the practitioner picked the correct hand 44% of the time. \n\nEmily's main goal here was to test whether or not the TT practicioners' guesses were random, like the flip of a coin. In most medical experiments, this is the norm. We want to test whether or not the treatment has an effect, *not* whether or not the treatment actually works. \n\nWe will now begin to formulate this experiment in terms of the terminology we learned in this course.

TT practitioners hit back and accused Emily and her family of tampering with the results, while some claimed that Emily's bad spiritual mood towards therapeutic touch made it difficult to read her HEF. Whatever it may be, Emily's experiment is a classic example about how anyone, with the right resources, can test anything they want!\n\nThink to yourself and be prepared to talk with your learning assistant and TA about the following questions as you get checked off: \n\n1. Do we reject Emily's hypothesis, or fail to reject it? \n2. What does this mean in terms of Emily's experiment? Do the TT practitioners' answers follow an even chance model or is there something else at play? \n\nCongratulations on finishing Lab 6!"
